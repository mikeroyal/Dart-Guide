# Dart Tools & Frameworks

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. Availble on Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS.

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an IDE for Java, but it also understands and provides intelligent coding assistance for a large variety of other languages such as Kotlin, SQL, JPQL, HTML, JavaScript, etc., even if the language expression is injected into a String literal in your Java code.

[Dart DevTools](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-devtools) is a suite of debugging and performance tools for Dart and Flutter. These tools are distributed in IDEs, the flutter tool, the webdev tool, and the [devtools package](https://pub.dev/packages/devtools).

[DartPad](https://www.dartpad.dev) is an online editor for Dart.

[Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/) is Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase using Dart.

[Pub](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd) is a  tool that has commands for managing packages and for deploying packages and command-line apps. 

[Analysis server](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analysis_server) is designed to provide on-going analysis of one or more code bases as those code bases are changing.

[Dart VM](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-vm) is a tool to run Dart command-line apps such as server-side scripts, programs, and servers.

[dart2js](https://dart.dev/tools/dart2js) is a tool to compile Dart code to deployable JavaScript. Another Dart-to-JavaScript compiler, [dartdevc](https://dart.dev/tools/dartdevc), is for development use only. The [webdev](https://dart.dev/tools/webdev#build) build command uses dart2js by default.

[dartdevc](https://dart.dev/tools/dartdevc) is the Dart development compiler that lets you run and debug your Dart web app in the Chrome browser.

[AngularDart](https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular) is a productive web application framework that powers some of Google's most critical applications. It's built on Dart and used extensively by Google AdWords, AdSense, Fiber, and many more projects.

[RxDart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) is a package with Reactive Extensions for Dart that adds additional capabilities to Dart [Streams](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-async/Stream-class.html) and [StreamControllers](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-async/StreamController-class.html).
